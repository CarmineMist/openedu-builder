# Quizify

## Description
This plugin can be used to transform quiz content. As of now, it supports parsing quizes in Markdown format and outputting iframes to be embedded into a Docusaurus website. This is customizable, both by implementing a custom quiz parser and by creating custom templates for quiz output.

## Options
| parameter | type | required | default | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `locations` | list[str] | `true` | `N/A` | A list of [`glob`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) patterns that expand to the locations of the files that link to quizzes. These are where the final output of this plugin will be embedded. |
| `parser_type` | str | `true` | `N/A` | Possible options: `regex` or `python`. This options specifies how the quiz is parsed. `regex` parsing is not implemented yet. |
| `parser` | str | `true` | `N/A` | If `parser_type` is `python`, this value specifies the path to the Python file that implements the parsing. This path can be relative to the location of the `quizify.py` file, inside the `quizify_parsers` folder or absolute. TBD for `regex`. |
| `quiz_type` | str | `true` | `N/A` | `link` or `regex`. `link` expects the `quiz_regex` option to be a regex with a single capture group for the path of the quiz. `regex` not implemented yet. |
| `quiz_regex` | str | `true` | `N/A` | Regex with a single capturing group for the path of the quiz. |
| `quiz_embed` | str | `true` | `N/A` | `iframe_link`, `replace` or `iframe_inline`. `iframe_link` not implemented yet. `replace` option will replace the quiz link with the parsed quiz content. `iframe_inline` will replace the quiz with an iframe that uses the `srcdoc` attribute for content. |
| `iframe_template` | str | `false` | `docusaurus_iframe` | In case one of the `iframe` options has been chosen for `quiz_embed`, this option specifies the Jinja2 template for the generated iframe. |
| `template` | str | `true` | `N/A` | This specifies the Jinja2 template used for generating the final quiz content. |

## Parsers

Parsers can be developed to fit any type of quiz, using Python.
In order to implement a parser, you need to write a Python file that has a `parse_quiz` function with the following signature:

```python
def parse_quiz(content, **kwargs):
```

The above function is expected to return a dictionary with the following keys: `question`, `wrong` (only the wrong answers), `answer` (the correct answer), `feedback` (optional)

The `quizify` plugin will call this function and provide the content of the quiz (the `content` parameter) alongside some metadata. For now, the metadata contains the path of the quiz and the line that matched when searching for the quiz. In order to account for future changes to the metadata, the `**kwargs` construct is used.

### md_parser.py

The `md_parser.py` parser will parse quizes that are in the following format:

```md
## Question Text

Is this a question?

## Question Answers

- this is a wrong answer
- this is also a wrong answer
+ this is a correct answer

## Feedback

Here is some optional feedback regarding the question.
```

The output of the parser is HTML.

The parser supports images inside a quiz, but they will be embedded as an `<img>` HTML tag, using base64 encoding.
The parser also supports code sections with proper formatting, but they will be converted to an image using the [`https://kod.so`](https://kod.so) API.

## Templates

### Quiz templates
Quiz templates will receive a dictionary with the following structure as an input:

```json
{
    "question": {
        "text": "Is this a question?",
        "id": "9b1deb4d-3b7d-4bad-9bdd-2b0d7b3dcb6d",
        "feedback": "Here is some optional feedback regarding the question",
    },
    "answers": [
        {
            "text": "this is a wrong answer",
            "id": "1b9d6bcd-bbfd-4b2d-9b5d-ab8dfbbd4bed"
        },
        {
            "text": "this is also a wrong answer",
            "id": "6ec0bd7f-11c0-43da-975e-2a8ad9ebae0b"
        },
        {
            "text": "this is a correct answer",
            "id": "ddeb27fb-d9a0-4624-be4d-4615062daed4"
        },
    ],
    "answer_id": "ddeb27fb-d9a0-4624-be4d-4615062daed4",
}
```

Depending on the way you want to present the quiz, you may, or may not need the ids.

### Iframe templates

Iframe templates will receive a dictionary with the following structure:
```json
{
    "iframe_id": "1b9d6bcd-bbfd-4b2d-9b5d-ab8dfbbd4bed",
    "quiz_content": "<here will be the output of the quiz template>",
}
```

All ids generated by the `quizify` plugin are UUIDv4.
